<p class="p1">...Bob Whaley another person, I would not have known if
not for this club.  On one trip, I wondered why someone had a whale
painted on a whitewater canoe until I met Bob and discovered his
sense of humor.  On my first full run of the <b>Ocoee</b>, I followed
Bob’s line through several rapids because it looked like he knew
what he was doing, and he did.</p>
<p class="p1">Years later, after a Goshen Pass run, Bob asked, “How
many 80 year old World War II veterans have you run the Pass with?”
 I said, “As far as I know, just one.”  When I asked if he was
returning the next day, he said, “No I can’t do the Pass two days
in a row anymore.”  I thought that anyone still running Goshen Pass
in their 80’s had a pretty good canoeing life.</p>
<p class="p2">Bob certainly did have a great paddling life and
shaared that life with many.  He will be missed.</p>
