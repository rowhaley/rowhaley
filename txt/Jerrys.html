A Whale of A Weekend</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">by
Dave Stockdill</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">On Friday
February 2, 1990, Bill Nicks, Larry Gross and I met Bob Whaley at the
Woodbine Recreation Area to paddle some of the tributaries of the
Gauley River.   I knew it was going to be a great weekend but I had
no idea it would be as great as it was.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">As we set the
shuttle for the Lower Cranberry, Bob suggested a new method of
stacking four solo canoes on one vehicle.  The first boat is centered
on the racks upside down.  Then two boats are put up, one on each
side of the bottom boat.  These are also upside down with one gunwale
on the rack and the other gunwale resting on the bottom of the center
boat. The outer boats are secured with the lines attached to the
center of the racks.  Now the fourth boat can be put up in the center
of the two outer also upside down.  Two lines are then added over the
top.  The painters of the outside boats are tied to opposite sides of
the vehicle making a secure package.  Having the painter lines
running diagonally also reduces the visual obstruction for the
driver. By the end of the weekend we had mastered this loading
technique which also works well with three boats.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">The Friday
morning run was a 9-mile class II - IV warm-up run on the Lower
Cranberry.  Friday afternoon we paddled the middle section of the
Cranberry.  This class III- V run would normally be the climax of a
paddling trip but for this weekend it was just the beginning. 
Saturday after finding the Williams to low too paddle we settled for
the Cherry.  The Cherry has nice whitewater if you can ignore the
trash along the banks and the sewerage treatment plant in Richwood.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Saturday
afternoon we east to camp intending to paddle Second Creek on Sunday.
 We ended up camping in the George Washington National Forest, the
closest freebie campsite available.  As we set up camp and prepared
supper, Bob mentioned another option.  Just a couple hundred yards
from our campsite was Jerry’s Run.  He had run it once before and
promised it would be “a trip you will remember the rest of your
life.”  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Sunday morning,
we bank scouted about a half mile of the stream and decided the water
level was about right.  We broke camp and left for breakfast at
Wendy’s in Covington.  It rained the whole time we ate and there
was some concern that there might be too much water.  Luckily the
rain let up and the water level remained steady.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">Bill and Lary in
their Sunburst IIs and Bob and I in our XL-13s put in between Batlick
and Brushy Mountains about a quarter mile upstream of our campsite
the night before.  Jerry’s Run is about 20’ wide below the low
water bridge at the put in and narrows to less than 13 feet as it
returns to its natural state in the forest.  The banks are low and
the scenery is beautiful when you get a chance to look.  There are
few eddies as Jerry’s Run drops 600 feet in 5.5 miles giving an
average gradient of 110 feet per mile.  In the first quarter mile we
encountered two trees in the river that had to be portaged.  It was
my intention to keep track of the number of strainers and ledges that
had to be carried but I lost count after five with many miles ahead
of us.  The first ledge we came to was a diagonal, river wide, 3 foot
drop that posed no problems.  After a few more bends in the river we
spotted our first horizon line of the morning.  Getting out to scout
we saw a 15 ft. slide.  The right side was dry and the left had a
huge boulder at the bottom.  Below the slide was a small pool and a
10 ft. waterfall full of jagged boulders, an honest class VI (Risk of
Life).  Bill and I had an easy carry on an old jeep trail on the left
while Larry and Bob carried on the right.  After a few more strainers
we came to another falls.  This one was a seven-foot sliding drop. 
After a quick boat scout I followed Bob in carrying on the right side
and Bill carried on the left.  Larry strapped on his helmet and ran
the drop making it look effortless.  By now I was getting accustomed
to doing ‘bank jams’ and jumping out of the boat quickly and it
was my turn to run probe.  After sliding over two more downed trees
we came to a small lake.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">The lake is
formed by a more than 100 ft. high railroad fill across the valley. 
As we neared the fill, I could see the opening of the tunnel that Bob
had described to us earlier.  There is a twenty-foot-wide tunnel
blasted through the mountain for the river to flow through.  Bob had
warned us about the tunnel and described it to us the night before. 
It was flat with a small drop near the far end.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">I watched as Bob
lined up and entered the tunnel.  I could see Bob and his boat
silhouetted by the light at the other end of the tunnel.  He was
staying close to the right wall.  As Bob began to disappear I
followed, there were logs along the left wall of the tunnel so I
stayed right.  Suddenly I saw a log jammed against the right wall. 
By the time I worked away from it I couldn’t see Bob.  I couldn’t
see anything.  Then I saw Bob’s head and I knew there was a drop
ahead.  Suddenly dead ahead of me was a ledge, I worked right where
there was more water and took the four foot drop.  Everything was
black except the light at the end of the tunnel with Bob’s
silhouette.  Then I heard a “YEEEOOOOO” behind me and I knew Bill
had come to the ledge.  Soon it got lighter and I was out.  I caught
the eddy on the left just behind Bob and jumped out of my boat, knees
shaking, as Bill and Larry caught the eddy.  Bob told us that the
drop in the middle of the tunnel was not there when he ran it 3 years
ago therefor it must have been caused by trees.  This tunnel has a
very real potential to kill someone.  The current is too swift and
confined to permit any rescue attempt.  If you ever get a chance to
run Jerry’s Run bring along a rope and strong lantern and lower a
boat down the tunnel to scout before you run it.  The life you save
may be your own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">	Below the tunnel
the gradient picked up again.  After we rounded a bend and paddled
another three-foot ledge a waterfall appeared.  This one we didn’t
scout.  The carry is up a steep hill to the left of the falls.  When
we got to the top and looked down on it this 20 ft. waterfall looked
runnable.  It had a glassy smooth tongue just left of center half way
down.  Below there were some rock outcroppings that looked benign and
another seven-foot drop to the bottom.  The remainder of the carry
over the boulders used in the railroad fill left numerous scars on my
new XL-13.  A glance up at the falls from midstream revealed that the
tongue lead right into the rock outcroppings rather than beside them
as it appeared from above.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">	From the falls
down the gradient decreases slightly and branches hang over the
river.  You soon become adept at laying your chest on your airbags to
duck under branches while doing a cross draw to catch a micro-eddy to
see what is coming next.  After three hours and five and a half miles
Jerry’s Run dumps into Dunlop Creek which is huge by comparison.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">	From Jerry’s
Run until just above the Humpback bridge Dunlop Creek is on a
plateau.  The gradient is good but there are few rapids.  There are
many foot bridges, at least two of which have been washed out leaving
cables in and above the water.  There are three dams on Dunlop Creek
between Jerry’s Run and the Jackson Fiver.  The first one has the
right bank washed away making for a smooth, safe bypass of this
potential hazard.  Just above the Humpback bridge is a six to eight
foot high dam that can be run at some water levels.  The day we were
there it a huge “glassy, Grand Canyon wave” as Bob Whaley put it.
 A fantastic smooth ride dooowwwn and uuuuppp and down.  After
passing under ti I-64 bridge there is a series of nice river wide
ledges.  Then the river makes a right hand U turn around a stone
quarry and into the backwater of the third dam.  The backwater is
short for a big (20 ft) dam, indicating there were probably some good
rapids there at one time.  After carrying this last dam there were no
more rapids until we reached a man-made channel.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
	Dunlop Creek has also been diverted for the railroad bed.  This
channel is cut through upstream slanted shale.  At this point Dunlop
Creek had about 1500 cfs and the bottom of this twenty foot wide
channel had a huge nasty hole.  The left side of the hole looked easy
enough to punch and the approach was clear.  I decided to run first. 
As I got nearer to the hole I could tell I was too far right so I
turned the boat left with the intention of paddling to the left and
then straightening out the boat.  Unfortunately the bow was now in
slower current than the stern and I couldn’t straighten out the
boat.  As I hit the hole sideways I braced for all I was worth.  My
low brace kept me upright but I couldn’t pull out of the hole.  As
I switched to a low high brace my right foot slipped off the foot
peg.   I managed to pull out of the hole but couldn’t roll up.  As
I was getting out of the boat I saw Larry beside me ready to give me
a hand.  He had hit the hole perfectly and punched through with no
trouble.  Next it was Bob’s turn.  Bob was lined up right and hit
the hole the same place Larry did and it looked like he would have no
trouble.  But the hungry hole grabbed his boat and pulled him in. 
Bob braced and worked his way river left nearly out of the hole but
the hole would not give up, it pulled Bob in and spat him out keeping
his boat to munch on for a while.  As Bob’s boat was tumbling in
the hole Bill began his approach.  When Bill got close enough he
could see Bob’s boat in the hole so he took several powerful
strokes to punch the hole in the center.  When Bill hit the hole he
was stopped dead immediately.  I have seen many paddlers hit a hole
and come part way out but I had never seen anyone hit a hole with
such speed and get stopped dead in his tracks.  His boat was tossed
sideways and he was windowshaded in an instant.  Bill’s boat was
still tumbling in the hole when he surfaced downstream.  Bob and Bill
were safely ashore as their boats finally came out of the hole. 
Before we left we ferried over to the river right side to take a look
from there.  Not only was the eddy pulsating but it was so powerful
that the eddy current had standing waves!  This last rapid was a
fitting end to a “trip I’ll remember the rest of my life”.</p>
