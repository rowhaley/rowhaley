	Bob Whaley was born June 22nd, 1926 in Victoria, Virginia.  He
        was the fourth of 4 brothers and has a younger sister.  As a
        child, he loved to swim in the nearby reservoir and play in
        the water and on the rocks at Nottoway falls.  At 12 or 13,
        with money from his paper route, he purchased a wood frame
        canvas kayak that had been built in the Victoria High School
        shop.  He paddled this kayak on the reservoir and on the James
        river near Williamsburg.
	<BR><BR> Just before he turned 18 in 1944 during WWII he enlisted in the
	Navy. He received engineering training at Gulfport,
	Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico.  After completing his
	training, he was stationed at the Golden Gate racetrack on San
	Francisco Bay.  He shipped out and worked in the engine room
	of LST and LSM ships in the Pacific.  He swam and body surfed
	at Waikiki beach, Enewetak atoll, and Guam.  After the
	surrender his ships visited Bohia Bay, Tianjin (formerly
	Tientsin), China and in Tokyo Bay, Japan.
	<BR><BR> On the GI bill, he graduated from Virginia Tech in
        1950.  He married Sally Ingle in 1952.  They lived in Richmond
        where he worked for American Tobacco manufacturing cigarettes
        in Shockoe Bottom near the James river fall line.  They had a
        son, Robert, Jr. in 1954.  Bob changed careers to
        manufacturing books when he moved to Berryville Virginia.
        Their daughter Beth was born in 1960.
        <BR><BR> The family moved back to Richmond in 1961 and then to
        Rockville, Maryland (not far from Great Falls) in 1965.  In
        1967 the family moved to Charlottesville.  Shortly after
        moving to Charlottesville, Bob starting paddling again.  He
        put together a Folbot kayak kit in the basement and made only
        a few river trips before it was pinned and destroyed in the
        Moormans River between the Doyle River confluence and
        Millington bridge.  He graduated to fiberglass canoes and then
        aluminum canoes (briefly including an aluminum square stern
        canoe).
	<BR><BR> Inspired by Randy Carter's guide book he became more
        adventurous.  He started to systematically canoe the streams
        of Virginia and neighboring states.  He paddled only open
        canoes (until much later when he occasionally tried
        inflatables and rafts).  He used home made flotation from
        discarded industrial chemical containers.  In the 1970s he
        began to paddle much more challenging white water with young
        friends who used decked boats.
	
        <BR><BR> He was one of the first open boat paddlers through
        Goshen Pass using his 17 foot Grumman.

        <BR><BR> To keep track of his trips he created a huge 9 foot
        by 8 foot map patched together from 20 USGS topographical
        maps.  He pasted the map to a wall in his house.  The map
        includes most of Virginia and West Virginia and parts of
        neighboring states.  He would ink in each new section and was
        always interested in paddling missing sections in order to
        complete entire watersheds.  You can see the map
	<a href="map_wo_poi.html">here</a>
	and with points of interest added
	<a href="map.html">here</a> (on these maps a click
	will zoom in to show details).
        <BR><BR> He started to travel further from Charlottesville.
        Initially he traveled to West Virginia, North Carolina,
        Tennessee, and Georgia.  His first wilderness trip was to the
        Romaine River in Quebec in 1978.  In the 1980s he made several
        more wilderness trips to Labrador and Quebec, Canada.  He
        traveled to paddle rivers in the Western United States.  In
        1989 he retired and made an epic trip to Alaska and other
        points in the West.  He returned to Alaska and paddled the
        length of the Yukon river in 1992.  Over the years he made
        numerous trips to the West paddling many rivers including the
        Rio Grande, Colorado, Green, Salmon, Snake and Owyhee.
        <BR><BR> He continued to paddle until 2010 when he was 84
        years old.  His last trip was on the Moormans River, starting
        on the Doyle River, under the Millington bridge, finishing at
        the Free Union bridge.
	<BR><BR> Bob passed away July 4th, 2023, twelve days after his
	97th birthday.  He is survived by Sally his wife of 71 years,
	his sister Janet of Charlottesville, his son Robert (Susan) of
	Charlottesville, his daugher Beth Johnson (Warren) of Suffolk,
	His grandchildren Christopher Johnson (Ashley) of South
	Carolina, and Mary Beth Miller (Alan), and his
	great-grandchildren Sarah Embry, Holton, and Elliott Miller of
	Orange.
