<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Sunday August
13<sup>th</sup> 5:05pm</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am sitting on the
Romaine river 120 miles from its mouth.  The river here is about 1/4
to 1/2 a mile across and spruce forest cover the hills that rise
about 400 feet from the river.  At this place the river looks like a
large mountain lake.  The waves are lapping at the shore.  I am
wearing a bug jacket though temperature is about 80F.  I expect to
eat in about one hour and then go to bed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>To Backtrack:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Left home 4:30 on
Friday August 11<sup>th</sup> 1978.  Arrived at Larry’s house 6:20.
 Left Larry’s around 7.  Picked up Phil in Columbia Md.  Larry’s
van had a bad fan belt.  Lost 1 hour fixing it.  Picked up Tom Cole
11:00 - 2 hours late.  My car cut off in the rain about ¾ of an hour
later.  C.B was a big help in notifying Larry.  After a short time it
started again.  It cut off again in upper New York State.  We found a
loose wire.  It seems OK now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We lost some time in
a small town outside Montreal trying to get a fishing license.  Tried
again in Quebec City, got lost again.  Still no fishing license.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Arrived in Harve St
Pierre at 6am Sunday morning; had breakfast and talked to air line
about flying in and rivers.  All rivers are low.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We decided to do
Romaine.  Put in was to be determined on first flight in.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We had decided to
fly in on Monday but decided to go in today at the suggestion of the
airline.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Jack Easterling did
not make trip.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am real tired but
still keyed up about this trip.  We will start down river tomorrow.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Monday Aug</b><b>ust</b><b>
14</b><sup><b>th</b></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My group job is to
prepare breakfast.  A good one for me since I am usually up early.  I
got up around 6:30.  Phil Leider in charge of fires was still asleep.
 I gathered tender from a large birch near our campsite and got the
fire started and put on water for coffee and laid out cereal
products.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Last night I slept
very well – went to bed about 7:30.  We did have a bunch of
mosquitoes in the tent and Paul Ferguson did do some snoring.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We paddled about ½
a mile down stream and had to portage a large water fall about 15
feet.  The portage not at all  bad.  Below the falls was a beautiful
sand beach bordered by extensive outcroppings of rock.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We ate lunch, some
fished, some hiked – no fish caught for lunch.  I hooked and lost 2
very small trout.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We canoed to the end
of this pond, made another portage then canoed with a strong wind at
our back about four additional miles. I stuck two paddles up into my
cagoule for a sail.  Larry used his paddle at a rudder and we really
moved out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The wind is still
blowing very fast.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">With the black
flies, mosquitoes and my small bladder, I am very glad  I brought
along my P jug.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">After lunch today I
sat down on a log overlooking the falls and had a very satisfactory
bowel movement in the prettiest of all toilets.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Tomorrow we expect
to have about 12 miles of easy paddling and then reach a very rough 5
mile section that may take as much as 3 days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Tuesday Aug</b><b>ust</b><b>
15 7pm</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Cloudy, windy, looks
like rain.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Last night was cold.
 The temperature dropped to 42F.  Today was windy, very cloudy and we
had some rain, perhaps as much as ½ inch.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Phil Leider and Tom
Cole decided to get up early and climb a small mountain along a small
stream that apparently was feed from a lake at the top..</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The rest of us slept
late and paddled down river to within hearing distance of a big
falls.  What should be the roughest part of the trip should be coming
up.  Judging from the scouting trips in by plane.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We are again camped
again on a sand bar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Tom Cole came back
with mosquito bites so thick he looked like a teen age boy with acne.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We stopped today at
what appeared to be an abandoned hunting camp.  Old cans had food
that appeared to still be good.  I picked up a aluminum pot that I
hope to get home to remind me of this trip.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Helicopters keep
coming up and down the river taking away from the experience.  They
come close and look.  At one point today I thought they were going to
land.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Apparently they are
making a survey of this river for a possible dam.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I am a little
fearful of tomorrow but if we use good judgment everything should be
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Last night just as I
finished writing a big gust of wind blew my tent down.  The tent is
OK.  I had to straighten several bent poles.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We made about 4 (I
think) short portages and one the book says is 300 kilometers [sic].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">A helicopter landed
in the rocks by our camp and one of the dam builders got out and came
over and talked, while the pilot and another man fished.  They said
the Romaine is the worst fishing river in this area.  The man from
the helicopter gave Tom Coron some tobacco.  Tom had run out several
days earlier. Tom was most elated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My elbow has been
squirting a yellow fluid.  I suspect I have punctured my fluid sac. 
It is tender but does not hurt.</p>

portages, some lining, and a tough ¾ mile portage into the basin,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Tom Cole and I cut
the portage trail.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The above is being
written on Saturday, Aug 26 at 10am.  We are camped in the Basin and
sort of catching up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I suspect we will
leave here around 11am and camp below a falls 13 miles down stream. 
Probably we will do 2 short portages today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I bumped my elbow
again yesterday.  It is tender and swollen some.  I think this elbow
is taking some of my strength, but I am keeping up pretty good.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My fingers are
cracked from the sand, wind, water, and cold, but have improved some.
 I should have used hand cream from the start.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We are camped above
two water falls separated by a runnable rapid  The whole river necks
down to about 30 feet and is most impressive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We did run one rapid
up stream that the guide book said to line on the left.  We are now
32 miles from the take out.</p>

wind, and clear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We made 4 portages
today and covered about 7 miles.  We are camped on a moss covered
rock high above the river with a beautiful view of Grand Chute – a
very impressive 90 ft waterfall.  Down stream is a rapid type of drop
that we will have to portage the first thing in the morning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We have
approximately 30 miles to go, mostly flat, separated by waterfalls.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">My elbow is the
same, swollen and squirts.  It is tender, but does not hurt.  My
hands are getting better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">It is nice to be off
the sand for one night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I didn’t mention
earlier, but it is nice to eat blue berries on almost all portages.</p>

night and enjoyed the Northern Light display, the view of the falls
and the crisp night air.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Made one short
portage.  Paddled 10 miles of flat water and ate lunch at Charlies
Chute.  Loafed, fished – no luck.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Saw evidence of
Indian camp and fish netting and salmon drying.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Our tent is on a
sand bar.  The door opens to  a beautiful view of Charlies Chute - a
15 foot drop with an island in the center – beautiful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Phil is counting
portages.  He says 26 so far.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We expect to paddle
about 10 miles tomorrow, make one portage, find a camp site and loaf.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The next day we
expect to get up early and paddle out.  Dave, Tom Coron and Paul
Ferguson are getting tired of the river and want very much to take
off.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I don’t want to
take off, but I would like to catch one good fish and see a moose,
some wolves and a bear.</p>

camp in a drizzle.  With the wind at our back and the itch to get
moving, we covered the first ten miles by 11:30am.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We started a fire
beside a railroad bridge support to warm ourselves from the wind,
rain and cool and started to eat lunch.  The fire caused moisture
expansion in the concrete which started breaking off, throwing rocks
and sand at us – no place for lunch.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We finished lunch in
a filthy dirty railroad line shack – it was warm but the most
uncomfortable time on the trip for me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The condition of
things indicated the judgment of – get off today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Larry and I paddled
out ahead of the group.  He watched the canoes and I caught a ride
into town with a man who wouldn’t or couldn’t speak English.  He
made no effort to communicate.  Interesting ride.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I packed up my van
at the police station drove back.  We checked into a motel.  I don’t
believe I am as glad to be off the river as the rest.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The beer and the
shower were fine.  Rock music from the bar downstairs kept me awake
most of the night.</p>
