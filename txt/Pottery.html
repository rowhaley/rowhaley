So, it was many years ago now, a river trip, an overnight canoe camper
on the Nottoway River, south of Richmond. Only three of us on hand,
Bob Whaley, Jon Deboer and Cris Leonard, all paddling solo. This trip
was Bob’s pick, a waterway he was always partial to. Fishing rods,
yes, but fish, no. Still it was a superb trip and weekend.

We found a wonderful camp site. We settled in, pitched tents, prepped
and consumed dinner, then sat back to relax while sharing elaborate
stories of our greatness. We also managed to [over] imbibe a smidgeon,
or vast quantities, of beverage.

Well after dark we ventured out in a (one) canoe for a Frog Gigging
adventure. I’m sure we had visions of a highly productive hunt -
followed by Frog Legs for breakfast. One man paddling astern, one man
midship, jockeying a high beam flashlight and one man in front, armed
with a deadly sharp gig. It was a disaster waiting to happen, a man
might have been killed that night. We were kinda noisy and there was
no chance we would sneak up on any Bullfrogs. Every one of them
escaped safe and uninjured. It was kinda like fishing, came back empty
handed.

Along this trip Jon grew enthused as he found some mysterious
“remnants” on a sandbar. Some pieces or shards, seemingly shaped and
crafted, he was so sure he had found something cool, a relic. Bob and
I taunted Jon mercilessly about the junk he had gathered and he
insisted on packing it out. He was sure it had to be of
significance. The ridicule continued over the river miles. It is
trash, Jon ….

As we concluded the trip, ran our shuttle and loaded for the drive
home, Jon somehow forgot about this valuable find. He left the
fragments, his treasure, in the back of Bob’s van.  Months and months
later, well over a year, Bob shared the rest of the story. Those
shards and fragments lingered in his van for some time. One day while
cleaning out said van (I’m sure this hardly ever happened), Bob tossed
those pieces next to his driveway, amongst his heat pump or electric
meter at home. They sat there for another length of time. Then one day
as yard work demanded attention, Bob picked up those pieces, boxed
them and put them in his car.

Days later, Bob stopped at The University Of Virginia and after
offering some background, and leaving his contact information, he left
the goods with the Archaeology Department. More time passed and the
School followed up with Bob. Yep. The pieces had been identified as a
cooking pot with past service to the Stony Creek Indians
[apparently(?) an arm or extension of the Nottoway Indians]. Jon was
right. And these were hard words to say.

A Staffer with UVA asked Bob if they could have the historic
pieces. Bob urged that they consider naming a museum wing after Jon,
and quickly agreed to the donation. With Bob’s generosity those old
scraps and fragments obviously wound up in good care. ,
