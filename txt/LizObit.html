<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><p class="p1">Liz Garland Deardorff</p>
<p class="p3">Coastal CaNEWS Fall 2023</p>
<p class="p1">Do you hear that cackling giggle?</p>
<p class="p1">My vision of the great beyond includes a fabulous river
and I know Bob is having a big time!  Coastal’s has lost a paddler
that many, myself included, call a mentor, a hero, and inspiration
and a friend. &nbsp;I’m comforted knowing he’s sharing an eddy or
a surf wave with paddling friends that went before him.  (Hummm, as
the new guy on that magical river he may be leaning into the entire
wave and just sharing a joyful grin.)</p>
<p class="p1">Going on a paddling trip with Bob would guarantee a
story and a memory.  My gateway to enjoying a river ‘Bob style’
was the result of meeting Larry Gross in a Mary Washington College
cartography class.  Our early morning weekday trips on the
Rappahannock led to weekend forays to chase water, many schemed to
fill gaps on the paper map that resided in Bob’s hallway.</p>
<p class="p2">I got to help Bob cover the map-- the entirety of
<b>Colliers Creek</b> (barbed wire fences and all) to Buffalo Creek into the
Maury fed by intense rain that turned into THE floods of 1985.  And
Bob helped me map new rivers-- leading Bill Hay and I down the upper
Gauley for the 1st time, trying to recall where Sweet’s Falls was
and finally hearing the happiest scream possible, “this is IT” as
he plunged over the lip too late for an eddy!  That’s the ‘Bob
style’ I loved to follow.</p>
