	Bob Whaley was born June 22nd, 1926 in Victoria, Virginia.  He
        is the fourth of 4 brothers and has a younger sister.  As a
        child, he loved to swim in the nearby reservoir and play in
        the water and on the rocks at Nottoway falls.  At 12 or 13,
        with money from his paper route, he purchased a wood frame
        canvas kayak that had been built in the Victoria High School
        shop.  He paddled this kayak on the resevoir and on the James
        river near Williamsburg.
	<BR><BR> When he turned 18 in 1944 he enlisted in the Navy. He
	received engineering training at Gulfport, Mississippi on the
	Gulf of Mexico.  After completing his training, he was
	stationed at the Golden Gate racetrack on San Francisco Bay.
	He shipped out and worked in the engine room of LST and LSM
	ships in the Pacific.  After the surrender his ships visited
	Boihia Bay, Tianjin, China and in Tokyo Bay, Japan.
	<BR><BR> On the GI bill, he graduated from Virginia Tech in
        1950.  He married Sally Ingle in 1952.  They lived in Richmond
        where he worked for American Tabacco manufacturing cigarettes
        in Shockoe Bottom near the James river fall line.  They had a
        son, Robert Whaley, Jr. in 1954.  Bob changed careers to
        manufacturing books when he moved to Berryville Virginia.
        Their daughter Beth was born in 1960.
        <BR><BR> The family moved back to Richmond in 1961 and then to
        Rockville, Maryland (not far from Great Falls) in 1965.  In
        1967 the family moved to Charlottesville.  Shortly after
        moving to Charlottesville, Bob starting paddling again.  He
        put together a Folbot kayak kit in the basement and made only
        a few river trips until it was pinned and destroyed in the
        Moormans River between the Doyle River confluence and
        Millington bridge.  He graduated to fiberglass canoes and then
        aluminium canoes (briefly including an aluminium square stern
        canoe).
	<BR><BR> Inspired by Randy Carter's guide book he became more
        adventureous.  He started to systematically canoe the streams
        of Virginia and neighboring states.  He paddled only open
        canoes (until much later when he occassionaly tried
        inflatables and rafts).  He used home made flotation from
        discarded industrial ink containers.  In the 1970s he begain
        to paddle much more challenging white water with young friends
        who used decked boats.
        <BR><BR> In the 1970s he was one of the first open boat paddlers
        through Goshen Pass using his 17 foot Grumman.
        <BR><BR> To keep track of his trips he created a 9 foot by 8
        foot map from 20 USGS topographical maps and pasted it to a
        wall in his house.  The map includes most of Virginia
        and West Virginia and parts of neighboring states.  He would
        ink in each new section and was always interested in paddling
        missing sections in order to complete entire watersheds.  You
        can see the map
	<a href="map_wo_poi.html">here</a>
	and with points of interest added
	<a href="index9.html">here</a> (on these maps a click
	will zoom in to show details).
        <BR><BR> He started to travel further from Charlottesville.
        Initially he traveled to West Virginia, North Carolina,
        Tennessee, and Georgia.  In the 1980s he made several
        Wilderness trips to Labrador and Quebec, Canada.  He travelled
        to paddle Western rivers.  In 1989 he retired and made an epic
        trip to Alaska and other points in the West.  He returned to
        Alaska and paddled the length of the Yukon river in 1992.
        Over the years he made numerous trips to the West paddling
        many rivers including the Rio Grande, Colorado, Green, Snake
        and Owyhee.
        <BR><BR> He continued to paddle until 2010 when he was 84
        years old.  His last trip was on the Moormans River from the
        Dolyle River, under the Millington bridge, finishing at the
        Free Union bridge.  He is currently (2021) working on maps of
        his trips to Canada and the West.
