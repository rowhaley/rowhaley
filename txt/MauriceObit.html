A Man for All Seasons</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Coastal CaNEWS Fall

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bob Whaley pulled
into his last take out of life on July 4<sup>th</sup>, 2023 and
relaxed into eternity at 97 years old.  How fitting. Having served
our nation in WWII defending our independence, that he left this
earth on July 4<sup>th</sup>. Life well done, Bob. RIP.  Our paddling
community sends our condolences to Bob’s family and friends.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bob began paddling
in the late 1960s (in his 40s) and continued until 2010 (age 84).  I
often told him he was my hero for padding good white water into his
80s.  To do this, Bob worked out a the gym several times each week. 
He also enjoyed nature, swimming, camping, fishing, scuba diving and
cross-county skiing.  I first saw Bob at my first (April 1978)
Coastals club meeting when I (then age 26) noticed the man with the
full head of white hair (he was only 52 then).  Bob enjoyed all types
of rivers, and considered the Maury River (Goshen Pass), Tye River,
and the Moormans River as his home rivers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bob had a unique way
to record his river exploits, by filling in the river sections with
ink on a topo map (primarily of Virginia, West Virginia, and North
Carolina) pasted to an inside wall of his house in Charlottesville. 
Bob enjoyed paddling entire rivers, including the Potomac River from
the headwaters n WV/MD to Washington DC as well as both branches of
the <b>Shenandoah River</b> into the Potomac.  That required paddling many
miles of flatwater, and Olie Fordham joined him on many of those
trips.  I often told Bob I appreciated he and Ollie taking those
trips so I didn’t have to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bob was an excellent
technical paddler.  John Butcher said, “Bob paddled with fewer
strokes than anybody else I’ve ever seen.”  As a result, few
paddlers ever got to see the Whale take a swim.  We were paddling in
Quebec, on the Rouge River’s Harrington Canyon section.  Bob hit
the horizon line above a 20-foot slide into a large hole, but
appeared to jump out of his boat (nobody’s perfect) just beyond the
horizon line.  In the eddy below, Butcher and I could not believe it.
 After reviewing the raft company videos several times at their
outpost, John coined the term “premature ejumpulation” to
describe Bob’s canoe exit.  Bob found the description quite
humorous.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Good paddling
partners are flexible and realistic, in a sport where water levels,
weather, and rapid difficulties can very widely.  Bob was that. 
Ollie Fordham, Don Bowman, the Whale, my son Brad, a client, and I
were rafting the Lower Gauley in my 14’ Solar. It was warm and we
were having a great day hitting the lines.  At the top of “Pure
Screaming Hell”, I suggested that we vote on whether to run or miss
the big hole, and the majority should rule.  The vote was 4-2 for
running it with Bob and Don against.  I explained what was necessary
for success.  With that crew, that day.  I gave us a 95% chance for a
clean run.  We pulled together, were right on line, had great
momentum when we hit the hole, and powered through it, drenched but
unscathed.  We were all ecstatic.  The smiles of achievement on Bob’s
and Don’s faces were priceless.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bob had a great
sense of humor.  John Butcher recounted one such moment on Chattooga
IV.  “Down at Tagaloo Like, after the whitewater, we faced the
one-hour paddle out across the lake in the heat.  Whaley noticed the
NOC raft trip: they tie the rafts to a skiff and take a powered trip
down the lake to the takeout.  Whale paddled up and surfed the wake
of this abomination until the guide took mercy and grabbed the bow of
his canoe.  We watched Whaley coast away, mopped our brows, cursed
him, and paddled into the heat.  When we arrived at the takeout,
sweaty and exhausted, Whaley was sitting in the shade with a can of
the Breakfast of Champions, laughing.”  Bob had the smirk of the
cat that are the canary, enjoying his triumph.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Brad Graver (then
16) added another look at Bob’s sense of humor, telling the
following story.  “Don and I were paddling the Shredder in
Tennessee on the Big Pigeon River.  Dad and Bob took a break and
pulled their canoes up on the bank, to make room for Don and I to
pull in.  My side of the Shredder was on the shallow bank side so I
could put my foot in the water to stand up, stop the boat and keep if
from moving further down the bank in the fast-moving current.  For
some reason Don stood up as we pulled in.  Well I took that
opportunity to rapidly exit the raft and the entire weight of Don’s
body became the only weight in the Shredder.  He quickly fell
overboard.  Bob nearly busted a gut laughing at Don from the bank. 
The water was cold, so Don wasn’t laughing, which made Bob laugh
even harder.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Bob had such a
positive spirit.  One day in early March, Bob and I were paddling the
Gauley River’s Crupperneck/Donnigan Mine sections.  Before
Summersville Lake was refilled as part of the annual flood control. 
We put in at the Cherry River confluence and planned to take out at
the boat landing on the lake West of the Route 19 bridge.  The trip
to the Route 39 bridge went smoothly, but as so often happens in WV –
weather changes.  The warm windless day turned into a cold, 50 mph
upstream gale wind.  We struggled to make any headway across the
lake.  We alternated paddling and walking on the muddy banks of the
drawn down lake.  I gritted my teeth and grumbled.  Bob smiled and
encouraged.  It took another 2+ hours to go less than the couple of
miles to the take-out as dusk approached.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Those who paddled
with Bob had great respect for him as a person.  Bob Card explained. 
“My father and I had a great relationship and we both enjoyed the
outdoors.  Several months after my father died, I began to call Bob
Whaley ‘Dad’.  It just felt right.”  The Whale had many
paddling buddies, including the following (in alphabetical order),
whom I could remember: Tom Blue, Don Bowman, Scott Broaddus, Neil
Burnett, John Butcher, Bob Card, Tome Cole, Andre Derdeyn, John
DeBoer, Paul Ferguson, Ollie Fordham, Les Fry, Liz Garland, Russell
Goin, Bob Gramann, Maurice and Brad Greaver, Larry and Christy Gross,
Lou Hannen, Dwight Holton, Nate Houser, Alicia Jahsmann, Phil Leider,
Chris Leonard, Gill and Doug Lipton, Tom, Tom Jr.. John, Ned and
George Michie, Chip Queitzsch, Conny Roussos, Glen Rose, DeWitt
Smith, Dave Stockdill, Steve Thomas, John and Linda Van Luik, Steve
Wagner, Jenny Wiley, and Sandy Williams.  (I’m sorry that I
probably missed some.)  I suspect all of them, have good Whaley
stories to tell … and all will miss him.  Doug Lipton summed up his
thoughts about Bob, going back to his paddling days as a young
teenager, “Bob’s sense of humor, his wit, and his warm smile that
exuded kindness, were exceptional traits to be bundled up into just
one person.  Every interaction I had with him was a positive
experience and I know he made the world a better place for those who
knew him.”</p>
